I'm Herbert Ullrich — researcher, developer, occasional teacher of both humans and machines.

Currently a **Graduate Research Intern** at the [Artificial Intelligence Center](https://aic.fel.cvut.cz/) in Prague (since 2020), where I poke at AI problems and try to make them poke back usefully. I also lecture for [AI dětem](https://aidetem.cz/) — teaching kids about AI since 2022, which turns out to be the best way to check whether you actually understand something.

Before that, I was an **Algorithms Tutor** at [Universität des Saarlandes](https://www.uni-saarland.de/) under prof. [Raimund Seidel](https://www.cs.uni-saarland.de/people/seidel.php), wrangling computational geometry and FFT into shapes that Master's students could digest. Made some lasting friends along the way.

On the industry side: **Full Stack Developer** at [STEM/MARK](https://www.stemmark.cz/) (2017–2018), building real-world web projects including a GDPR-friendly yoga licensing platform and a nutritional therapy portal. Before that, three years at Yeti Studio and three summers interning at ON Semiconductor, where I shipped Android/iOS apps and optimised [onsemi.com](https://www.onsemi.com/).

In short: I write code, teach things, and research stuff. Sometimes all at once.
