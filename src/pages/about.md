I'm Herbert Ullrich — researcher, developer, occasional teacher of both humans and machines.

Currently a **PhD Candidate** at the [Artificial Intelligence Center](https://aic.fel.cvut.cz/) in Prague (since 2021), where I poke at AI problems and try to make them poke back usefully. I also lecture for [AI dětem](https://aidetem.cz/) — teaching kids about AI since 2022, which turns out to be the best way to check whether you actually understand something.

In short: I write code, teach things, and research stuff. Sometimes all at once.
