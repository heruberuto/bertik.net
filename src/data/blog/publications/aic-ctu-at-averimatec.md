## Abstract

This paper introduces a dual-retriever RAG system for multimodal fact-checking, combining textual and image-aware evidence retrieval before verdict generation. The architecture is built to reduce hallucinations by forcing stronger evidence alignment across modalities.

## Notes

A highlight of this project was a bronze-medal finish in AVeriTeC 2. Beyond leaderboard performance, we are proud that the system remained interpretable: retrieval traces made it easier to analyze failures and iterate quickly.
