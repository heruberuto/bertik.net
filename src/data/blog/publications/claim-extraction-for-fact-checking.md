## Abstract

The work examines claim extraction as a dedicated subtask for fact-checking, introducing data, modeling strategies, and automatic metrics tailored to claim quality. It analyzes the trade-off between extracting many candidate claims and extracting claims that are specific, verifiable, and useful downstream.

## Notes

In practice, this paper helped us treat claim extraction as a first-class modeling problem rather than a preprocessing detail. Better claim quality noticeably improved retrieval focus and final verification reliability in later pipelines.
