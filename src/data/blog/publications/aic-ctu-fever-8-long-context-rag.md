## Abstract

Our FEVER 8 system explores on-premise fact-checking with long-context retrieval-augmented generation. We focus on practical deployment constraints, retrieval quality over long documents, and evidence-aware generation that keeps outputs grounded in retrieved passages.

## Notes

This submission reflects our preference for reproducible, controllable pipelines: instead of relying on closed hosted systems, we showed that competitive fact-checking can be done in an on-prem setup with careful long-context retrieval design.
