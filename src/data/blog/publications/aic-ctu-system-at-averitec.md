## Abstract

We recast automated fact-checking as a retrieval-augmented generation task: retrieve relevant evidence, then generate a verdict and justification directly from that evidence. The paper details a lightweight but effective pipeline and discusses where simplification helps versus where specialized modules are still needed.

## Notes

This was an important baseline paper for our team. It proved that a strong, well-tuned RAG approach can be surprisingly competitive, and it directly informed the system ideas we later pushed further in subsequent shared tasks.
