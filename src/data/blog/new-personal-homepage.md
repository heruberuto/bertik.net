After years of accumulating digital baggage across various platforms, I finally have a proper homepage.

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) — fast, minimal, and easy enough that I actually shipped it instead of endlessly bikeshedding the tech stack.

Expect the occasional post about research, teaching, and whatever else catches my attention. No newsletters, no trackers, no dark patterns — just words and the occasional code snippet.

Welcome.
